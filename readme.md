# 🧠 Mental Health Post Risk Detector

This project is a **web application** designed to analyze text (simulated social media posts) for **mental health risk levels** using a **deep learning ensemble model**.  
The system operates using a **two-tier architecture** — a Streamlit frontend and a dedicated Python API backend.

---

## 🧩 System Overview

| Service | Technology | Role | Port |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** (`app.py`) | Streamlit | Provides the web interface and handles user input | `5000` |
| **Backend API** (`api_server.py`) | Flask / PyTorch / Transformers | Hosts the `MentalHealthEnsemble` model and performs predictions | `5001` |
| **Database** (`risk_analysis_log.db`) | SQLite (via SQLAlchemy) | Logs every analysis request for auditing and tracking | *(File-based)* |

---

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

Follow these steps exactly to set up and run both the backend and frontend services.

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It’s **critical** to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\Risk_Chat

# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv venv_new

# Activate the environment
.\venv_new\Scripts\activate

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py


The app will automatically open in your browser at:
👉 http://localhost:5000/

⚠️ Troubleshooting Guide
Error Message	Cause	Fix
ConnectionError / Model service timed out	The backend (api_server.py) is not running or the models took too long to load.	1. Check Terminal 1: ensure the API server is running and shows Running on http://0.0.0.0:5001/.
2. Increase timeout: open app.py, find APIModelClient.predict, and change timeout=60. Restart both services.
ModuleNotFoundError	Dependencies installed in the wrong Python environment.	Recreate the virtual environment and reinstall all dependencies. Always ensure the environment is active before installing packages. You can also run:
.\venv_new\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run app.py
ValueError: DATABASE_URL environment variable not set	The mandatory environment variable is missing.	Run:
set DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./risk_analysis_log.db before starting the app.

💡 Notes

Always start api_server.py before app.py, since the frontend depends on the backend API.

Use the same virtual environment for both terminals.

You can stop both services anytime using Ctrl + C in their respective terminals.

🧩 Future Improvements

Add user authentication and session management

Integrate visualization dashboards for historical risk trends

Deploy the system using Docker or cloud services

Add multi-language text support
